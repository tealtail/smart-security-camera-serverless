# Smart Security Camera - Serverless Framework

This project is an off-shoot of the truly excellent work done in [@markwest1972's smart-security-camera project](https://github.com/markwest1972/smart-security-camera) to create a motion detecting Raspberry Pi webcamera, backed by lambda functions and using AWS Rekognition for label detection and "smart" email alerts.

I turned this into a Serverless Framework project because I wanted a faster development and deployment cycle.
